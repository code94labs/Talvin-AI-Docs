## Accessing API Key Management

1. **Log in to Talvin AI**: Go to [https://app.talvin.ai](https://app.talvin.ai) and sign in to your account.
2. **Navigate to Settings**: In the application, go to the **Settings** section.
3. **Select Integrations**: Click on **Integrations** to access the **API Keys** section.

## Understanding Your Organization ID

At the top of the **Integrations** page, youâ€™ll find your **Organization ID** (e.g., `org_2wfr1fypcw3QC6quBxj2XRcuRGq`). This unique identifier is essential for configuring integrations and contacting support for assistance with your account's integrations. To copy it, click the copy icon next to the ID.

## Creating a New API Key

1. In the **API Keys** section, click the **Create API Key** button.
2. A **Create New API Key** pop-up will appear. Enter a descriptive name for your API key (e.g., `Production API Key`).
3. Click **Create API Key** in the pop-up.
4. A **Your New API Key** pop-up will display the generated API key. **Important**: Copy or download this key immediately, as it will not be visible again for security reasons.

## Rotating an API Key

1. Locate the API key you wish to rotate in the **API Keys** list.
2. Under the **Actions** column, click the **Rotate** icon (a circular arrow).
3. A **Rotate API Key** pop-up will appear, warning that this action will generate a new key and invalidate the old one, requiring updates in any services using it.
4. Click **Rotate Key** to confirm.
5. A **Your New API Key** pop-up will display the new API key. **Important**: Copy or download this key immediately, as it will not be visible again for security reasons.

## Revoking an API Key

1. Locate the API key you wish to revoke in the **API Keys** list.
2. Under the **Actions** column, click the **Delete** or **Revoke** icon (a trash can).
3. A **Revoke API Key** pop-up will appear, stating that this action cannot be undone and will permanently revoke the API key, breaking any integrations using it.
4. Click **Revoke Key** to confirm. A success notification will appear at the bottom right.
